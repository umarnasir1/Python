    "# There are a few things to watch out for when naming variables in Python.\n",

    "# 2. You can’t use Python's reserved words, or \"keywords,\" as variable names. There are reserved words in every programming language that have important purposes. Creating names that are descriptive of the values often will help you avoid using any of these keywords.\n",
